# Album

- The app is composed of 2 screens, first is the profile screen, it has the user
name and address pinned at the top and then it lists all of this userâ€™s albums. You
can get user albums by requesting the albums endpoint and passing userId as a
parameter.
When you press on any album it navigates to the second screen which is an
album details screen. You request the photos endpoint and pass album id as a
parameter, then list the images in an Instagram-like grid. Also, there should be a
search bar that you can filter within the album by the image title, when you start
typing the screen should show only images that are related to this search query.
